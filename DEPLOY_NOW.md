## üéØ Two Ways to Deploy:

### Option 1: From Your Local Computer (Easiest)

If you have a computer with a browser:

1. **Open terminal on your LOCAL computer** (not Gitpod)

2. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

3. **Login**:
   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Open your browser
   - Ask you to sign in with Google
   - Show you a token
   
4. **Copy the token** (looks like `1//0xxxxxxxxx...`)

5. **Add to Gitpod**:
   - Go to: https://gitpod.io/user/variables
   - Click "New Variable"
   - Name: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
   - Value: (paste the token)
   - Scope: `Moeabdelaziz007/AuraOS-Monorepo`
   - Click "Add"

6. **Restart this Gitpod workspace**

7. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   gitpod automations task start deploy-firebase
   ```

**Your app will be live at:** https://selfos-62f70.web.app

### Option 2: Deploy from Local Machine Directly

If you want to deploy from your local computer instead:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moeabdelaziz007/AuraOS-Monorepo.git
   cd AuraOS-Monorepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

4. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/ui
   pnpm run build
   cd ../..
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

**Your app will be live at:** https://selfos-62f70.web.app

## üîç Understanding the Two Types of Firebase Auth:

### 1. Client-Side Config (Already Done ‚úÖ)
This is what you shared:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCiZQHxCQZ0Jy_PjUTBX1cdJ7YfHnsJ8zQ",
  // ... etc
};
```
**Purpose:** Your app uses this to connect to Firebase services (auth, database, storage)  
**Status:** Already configured in `.env` files

### 2. CLI Authentication (What You Need ‚ùå)
**Purpose:** Allows the Firebase CLI to deploy your app  
**How to get it:** Run `firebase login:ci` on a computer with a browser  
**Status:** Not set up yet - this is what's blocking deployment

## üÜò Can't Access a Local Computer?

If you don't have access to a local computer with a browser, you have two options:

### A. Use GitHub Actions (Requires Service Account)

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/selfos-62f70/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk
2. Click "Generate New Private Key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. Go to: https://github.com/Moeabdelaziz007/AuraOS-Monorepo/settings/secrets/actions
5. Add secret:
   - Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   - Value: (paste entire JSON contents)
6. Fix GitHub billing issue
7. Push to main or manually trigger workflow

### B. Ask Someone with Access

Ask someone who has:
- Access to the Firebase project (selfos-62f70)
- A computer with a browser

They can run `firebase login:ci` and share the token with you securely.

---

## üìä Check Your Setup:

Run this anytime to see what's configured:

```bash
bash scripts/firebase-auth-check.sh
```

---

## üéâ After Deployment:

Your app will be available at:
- **Primary:** https://selfos-62f70.web.app
- **Alternative:** https://selfos-62f70.firebaseapp.com

You can also view it in Firebase Console:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/selfos-62f70/hosting

---

**Bottom line:** You need to run `firebase login:ci` on a computer with a browser to get the deployment token.
