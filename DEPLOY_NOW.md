## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended) ⭐

**Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions workflow.**

#### Steps:

1. **Merge to main branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/meta-learning-autopilot
git push origin main
```

2. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Moeabdelaziz007/AuraOS-Monorepo/actions
   - Watch "Deploy to Firebase" workflow
   - Wait for ✅ completion (~3-5 minutes)

3. **Access deployed site:**
   - https://auraos-ac2e0.web.app
   - https://auraos-ac2e0.firebaseapp.com

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ No local authentication needed
- ✅ Automatic on every push to main
- ✅ Build logs available
- ✅ Rollback capability

### Option 2: Local Deployment with Firebase CLI

**Deploy from your local machine.**

#### Prerequisites:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login
```

#### Deploy:

```bash
# From project root
cd apps/landing-page
pnpm build
cd ../..
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**When to use:**
- Testing deployments
- Quick updates
- Preview channels

---

### Option 3: Firebase Token (Gitpod/CI)

**For non-interactive environments.**

#### Get Token:

```bash
# On your local machine
firebase login:ci
```

This opens browser and gives you a token like: `1//0xxxxxxxxx...`

#### Use Token:

```bash
# In Gitpod or CI
export FIREBASE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
firebase deploy --only hosting --token "$FIREBASE_TOKEN"
```

**Or add to Gitpod:**
1. Go to: https://gitpod.io/user/variables
2. Add variable: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
3. Restart workspace

7. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   gitpod automations task start deploy-firebase
   ```

**Your app will be live at:** https://selfos-62f70.web.app

---

### Option 2: Deploy from Local Machine Directly

If you want to deploy from your local computer instead:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moeabdelaziz007/AuraOS-Monorepo.git
   cd AuraOS-Monorepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

4. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/ui
   pnpm run build
   cd ../..
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

**Your app will be live at:** https://selfos-62f70.web.app

## 🔍 Understanding the Two Types of Firebase Auth:

### 1. Client-Side Config (Already Done ✅)
This is what you shared:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCiZQHxCQZ0Jy_PjUTBX1cdJ7YfHnsJ8zQ",
  // ... etc
};
```
**Purpose:** Your app uses this to connect to Firebase services (auth, database, storage)  
**Status:** Already configured in `.env` files

### 2. CLI Authentication (What You Need ❌)
**Purpose:** Allows the Firebase CLI to deploy your app  
**How to get it:** Run `firebase login:ci` on a computer with a browser  
**Status:** Not set up yet - this is what's blocking deployment

## 🆘 Can't Access a Local Computer?

If you don't have access to a local computer with a browser, you have two options:

### A. Use GitHub Actions (Requires Service Account)

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/selfos-62f70/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk
2. Click "Generate New Private Key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. Go to: https://github.com/Moeabdelaziz007/AuraOS-Monorepo/settings/secrets/actions
5. Add secret:
   - Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   - Value: (paste entire JSON contents)
6. Fix GitHub billing issue
7. Push to main or manually trigger workflow

### B. Ask Someone with Access

Ask someone who has:
- Access to the Firebase project (selfos-62f70)
- A computer with a browser

They can run `firebase login:ci` and share the token with you securely.

---

## 📊 Check Your Setup:

Run this anytime to see what's configured:

```bash
bash scripts/firebase-auth-check.sh
```

---

## 🎉 After Deployment:

Your app will be available at:
- **Primary:** https://selfos-62f70.web.app
- **Alternative:** https://selfos-62f70.firebaseapp.com

You can also view it in Firebase Console:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/selfos-62f70/hosting

---

**Bottom line:** You need to run `firebase login:ci` on a computer with a browser to get the deployment token.
