## 📊 Metrics Explained

### Pattern Accuracy (0-1)
Measures how often detected patterns lead to correct predictions.
- **High (>0.7):** System is accurately identifying patterns
- **Medium (0.4-0.7):** Patterns are somewhat reliable
- **Low (<0.4):** Pattern detection needs improvement

### Insight Relevance (0-1)
Measures how often users acknowledge/act on insights.
- **High (>0.7):** Insights are valuable to users
- **Medium (0.4-0.7):** Some insights are useful
- **Low (<0.4):** Insights need better personalization

### User Engagement (0-1)
Based on session frequency and duration.
