- 🔴 No production deployment
- 🔴 Missing essential features
- 🔴 No monitoring/logging

### Path Forward:

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 8-12 weeks  
**Estimated Time to Production:** 16-20 weeks  
**Estimated Cost:** $106,000 - $156,000  
**Recommended Team Size:** 5-7 people

### Success Probability:

With proper resources and focus:
- **MVP Launch:** 80% likely in 3 months
